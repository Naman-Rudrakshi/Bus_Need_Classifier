This was my first personal ML project, completed as part of SAAS DF FA25. The goal is to classify students and neighborhoods by their likelihood of needing a school bus, helping districts design bus routes that best meet student transportation needs. Data: 2017 National Household Travel Survey, U.S. Department of Transportation. Model: Random Forest Classifier. Thank you to Brandon, Arnav, Avery, Sona, and the rest of DF for supporting this project.
